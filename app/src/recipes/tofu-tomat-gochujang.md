- 1¼ cups + 1 Tbsp (243 g) uncooked long-grain white rice
- 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp (20 mL) vegetable oil
- 15 oz (427 g) firm tofu, pressed, cut into 1 cm cubes
- ⅓ cup (97 g) gochujang chili paste, or less for less heat
- 6.7 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 Tbsp (60 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce
- 2½ Tbsp + ½ tsp (37 g) brown sugar
- 4⅔ cups (700 g) cherry tomatoes, halved

Garnering
- sliced green onion
- toasted sesame seeds

1. Cook the rice according to the package instructions.
2. Meanwhile, add the oil to a sauté pan over medium-high heat and cook the tofu until golden on all sides, about 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, mix the gochujang, garlic, soy sauce, and sugar in a bowl. Set aside.
4. When the tofu is golden, transfer it to a plate. Add the tomatoes to the now-empty pan, and cook for 3 minutes.
5. Then, add the sauce and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
6. Stir in the tofu, then serve alongside the warm rice. Garnish as desired, and enjoy!
